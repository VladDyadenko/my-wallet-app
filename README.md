## Project Description

This web application allows the user to connect their wallet, check their account balance and wallet address, and perform a token transfer from the connected wallet to another address on the Ethereum Goerli network.

## Usage

1. When you first get to the application page, it will check if you have a connection to the extension MetaMask.
   If the extension is already installed, you will be taken to the main page and can use the button "Connect MetaMask?" to connect to your wallet.
2. If the extension is not available, you will be able to go to the extension page, read the necessary information and install it. After that, click on the link that informs the application that the extension is already installed. And then back to point 1.
3. If the connection procedure was successful, you will see your balance and wallet address.
4. Now you can send the required amount from your wallet to the address you specified.
   It should also be noted that the information you enter will be checked for balance sufficiency and the correct address of the wallet to which the transaction is planned. If the check is not passed - there is an error when entering, the button "Send" will be inactive. This allows you to avoid errors when transferring your funds.
